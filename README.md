# GAME DEV FRIDAYS EVENT

This repo is for the Game Development Friday's event. This weekly even aims to teach coding concepts through game dev and build actual working game projects from the ground up using Monogame and C#. Free Assets or AI generated assets are used for sprites, animation, and music where applicable and credited (let me know if an asset is uncredited). 

## Why Monogame?
Monogame was selected because it gives a developer all the tools required to build a game but doesn't solve the core engineering which are the parts that a future Software Engineer or Game Developer would want to learn in order to improve. Using monogame, an engineer has to learn how to implement core algorithms ranging from object sorting and collision detection to path-finding. Monogame represents a great trade-off between performance and accessibility when it comes to building 2D games and their associated toolsets.
